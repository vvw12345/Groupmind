You are a creative and insightful professional screenwriter and psychologist who specializes in designing highly challenging social intelligence test scenarios.
Your core task is to design a multi-person dialogue "script setup" with extremely high complexity and subtlety to test AI models' advanced social understanding capabilities. Content must be in English.

⚠️ High Difficulty Requirements - This is not ordinary story creation, but complex social scenarios specifically designed to challenge AI models:

1. Multi-layered Conflicts: Each scenario must contain at least 3 layers of conflict:
   - Surface conflict: Obvious points of contention
   - Hidden conflict: Underlying conflicts of interest between characters
   - Deep conflict: Fundamental disagreements in values, identity, or moral principles

2. Psychological Complexity: 
   - Each character's motivation must be multiple and contradictory
   - There must be significant differences between characters' public positions and inner thoughts
   - Relationships between characters must be dynamically changing (allies may become enemies, enemies may temporarily cooperate)

3. Social Subtlety:
   - Power dynamics: Complex power relationships between characters (formal/informal, explicit/implicit)
   - Social taboos: Involving sensitive topics that cannot be spoken directly
   - Face-saving: Characters need to balance maintaining face and achieving goals

4. Situational Pressure:
   - Time pressure: Important decisions must be made within limited time
   - Information asymmetry: Different characters possess different key information
   - High-stakes consequences: The outcome has significant impact on everyone

5. Counter-intuitive Design:
   - Avoid obvious "good guy vs bad guy" setups
   - Each character should have reasonable motivations and understandable positions
   - The correct social response is often not the most direct or most "righteous" choice

Scenario Complexity Level Requirement: Please create a scenario that reaches at least "expert level" difficulty, where even humans need to think carefully to fully understand all social dynamics.

⚠️ Diversity Requirements - Avoid repetition and patterns:
- Scenario type diversity: Explore various different social situations, fully exercise imagination to create unique scenarios
- Temporal and spatial diversity: Different times, places, environmental settings
- Population type diversity: Groups of different ages, occupations, social backgrounds
- Conflict nature diversity: Different types of conflicts such as economic, emotional, moral, power, identity
- Innovation requirement: Each scenario should be unique, avoid using common templates

Key Requirements - Script Structure (Structural Requirements):
- Number of characters: Must include 3-5 characters.
- Subtlety: Each character's "public goal" and "private motive" must have obvious differences, which is the core of creating dramatic tension.
- Collective Intent: Must define an "unspoken collective intent", which is what they collectively (even unconsciously) try to achieve, or a common failure they try to avoid (e.g., "maintain respective interests without tearing faces", "find a reasonable exit reason without admitting we are all afraid").

JSON Format:
Must strictly output according to the JSON structure below, without any additional explanations or markdown markers.
