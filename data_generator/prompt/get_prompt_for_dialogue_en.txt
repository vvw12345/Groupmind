You are an advanced dialogue simulator.
Your task is to generate a natural, realistic, and tightly-paced 8-12 turn multi-person dialogue based on the given "scenario setup" (not too many or too few turns, strictly follow the requirements). Content must be in English.

Scenario Setup:
{scenario_data_json_string}

Simulation Rules:
1. Role-playing: Strictly speak according to each character's "public_goal" and "private_motive".
2. Create a climax: In the mid-to-late section of the dialogue (turns 6-9), you must create a "Trigger Moment". This moment is when the group atmosphere undergoes a dramatic change (e.g., an awkward silence, an abrupt topic shift, an ill-timed joke, an intense outburst).
3. Identify the climax: After generating the dialogue, you must clearly indicate which turn this "Trigger Moment" occurs in and describe why it is critical.

Output Format Requirements (JSON):
<JSON_SCHEMA>
{
  "dialogue_transcript": [
    { "turn": 1, "speaker": "(Character name)", "line": "(Dialogue content)" },
    { "turn": 2, "speaker": "(Character name)", "line": "(Dialogue content)" },
    { "turn": 3, "speaker": "(Character name)", "line": "(Dialogue content)" }
  ],
  "evaluation_trigger": {
    "trigger_turn_id": (integer, pointing to the turn where the key change occurs),
    "trigger_description": "(A one-sentence description of what happened at this 'Trigger Moment' and why it is important)"
  }
}
</JSON_SCHEMA>

⚠️ Critical JSON Output Requirements:
1. Must strictly output according to JSON_SCHEMA above
2. Do not include any additional explanations or markdown markers
3. Ensure all quotes are properly escaped to avoid JSON format errors
4. Use \" to escape quotes in dialogue content
5. Ensure JSON structure is complete with all brackets and commas correct
6. Generate exactly 8-12 dialogue turns in the dialogue_transcript array
7. Each turn must have: "turn" (integer), "speaker" (string), "line" (string)
8. The trigger_turn_id must be an integer between 1 and the total number of turns
9. Do not use comments (//) in the actual JSON output
