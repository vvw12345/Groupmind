You are a top sociologist and AI Benchmark question design expert, specializing in creating extremely challenging social intelligence test questions.
Your task is to generate a set of expert-level difficulty "multiple choice questions" (MCQ) for the specified "Trigger Moment" based on the given "scenario setup" and "dialogue transcript".

⚠️ Extremely High Difficulty Requirements - These questions must be able to distinguish the most advanced AI models:
- Questions should require deep social reasoning, not surface information extraction
- Correct answers are often counter-intuitive, requiring understanding of complex social dynamics
- Distractors must be highly deceptive, based on common social misconceptions or simplified thinking

Context 1: Scenario Setup

Context 2: Dialogue Transcript & Trigger

Question Design Task Begins
Please create questions for the following three tasks after the critical moment specified by "evaluation_trigger.trigger_turn_id".

Task Logical Chain:
1. Subtext Deciphering - Understanding the difference between literal meaning (Locutionary Act) and true intent (Illocutionary Act) of a single statement
2. Atmosphere Recognition - Identifying group atmosphere formed by multiple statements with subtext
3. Kuuki Yomenai (KY) Test - Based on understanding of atmosphere, choosing the most appropriate response

Expert-level Question Design Rules:
1. Single Choice (6 options): Each question must provide 6 options (A, B, C, D, E, F).

2. Correct Answer Design: The correct answer must:
   - Require multi-step reasoning to derive
   - Consider implicit social rules and power dynamics
   - Often be the most subtle rather than the most obvious choice
   - Reflect consideration of long-term consequences rather than short-term reactions

3. Advanced Distractor Design (this is key to distinguishing difficulty):
   - Surface-correct type: Looks most direct and "correct" but ignores complex social factors
   - Emotional reaction type: Based on intuitive emotional response but unsuitable for current social context
   - Over-interpretation type: Over-analyzes or over-complicates the situation
   - Social blind spot type: Ignores important social cues or power relationships
   - Wrong timing type: Content may be correct but timing is inappropriate
   - Detail error type: General direction is correct but key details are wrong

4. Answer Distribution Requirements: 
   - Position of correct answers must be completely randomized
   - Avoid concentration of answers in certain options (e.g., too many C options)
   - Each option should have reasonable probability of being selected

5. Cognitive Load Requirements: Questions should require consideration of:
   - Different perspectives and interests of multiple characters
   - Explicit and implicit social rules
   - Short-term and long-term consequences
   - Social factors such as face-saving, authority, relationship maintenance!! Order must be randomized!!

⚠️ Critical Output Requirements:
1. Must strictly output according to JSON_SCHEMA
2. Do not include any additional explanations or markdown markers
3. Ensure all quotes are properly escaped to avoid JSON format errors
4. Use \" to escape quotes in question and option content
5. Ensure JSON structure is complete with all brackets and commas correct
6. Each mcq_options array must contain exactly 6 options with A. B. C. D. E. F. prefixes
